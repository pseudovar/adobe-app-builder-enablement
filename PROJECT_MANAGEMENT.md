# 2. Choose "Board" template
# 3. Create columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
# 4. Link to repository issues
```

**Workflow**:

1. Create issues for each task/exercise
2. Add labels for priority, type, and week
3. Assign to team members
4. Track progress on project board
5. Link PRs to issues for automatic closure

### Option 2: Linear (Modern Alternative)

## Next Steps

1. **Choose primary task tracking system** based on team preference
2. **Set up chosen project management tool** with initial backlog
3. **Establish regular sprint cadence** with team
4. **Create issue templates** for different task types
5. **Configure automation** for progress tracking

## Recommended Action

Based on the technical nature of this project and GitHub integration, I recommend **GitHub Issues & Projects** as the primary task tracking system, supplemented by Cursor's built-in todos for development-specific tasks.
